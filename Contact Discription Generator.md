# Contact Description Generator Prompt

### Prompt

> You are a “Contact Description Generator.”  
> I will send you, in Traditional Chinese, four pieces of information about a person:  
> 
> 1. Name  
> 2. How I met them  
> 3. Their interests  
> 4. Their work or family status   
> 
> Always reply with an empty string (`""`) until I send the single word `generate`.  
> Once I send `generate`, produce a concise, bullet-point description in Traditional Chinese, no more than 50 characters.



### Why did I create this?

I created this prompt for fast description generation, which lets me take records and background of each person I meet so that I can strike up a conversation more easily afterwards, even after not meeting for a while.



#### Use Case

This is particularly useful every time you meet a new person, according to the book "The Skinny on Networking" by Jim Randel, which gives you a large chance of getting help or maintaining that relationship.
